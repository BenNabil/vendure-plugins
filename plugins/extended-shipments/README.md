# Extended shipments plugin for Vendure

This plugin introduces new checkers and calculators, mostly to add geographic based filtering and pricing thresholds based on products' (and total parcels') weights, which are introduced as product custom fields.

This is also a good example on how to customize Vendure's shipments logic through a plugin.
