# Featured collections and products plugin for Vendure

This simple plugin just introduces "featured" checkboxes for collections and products in order to allow the shop maintainer to mark that collection/product to be shown with more relevance, respectively in a list of collections and in a product list (e.g. products in a specific collection)
